# This is a clone of the UI of Hulu Landing Page
The idea came from a Tutorial on Youtube but I added a section where you have 3 tabs and you can switch between them.
I had problems to add this feature because i was training with Javascript but was too complex for me and i could not do it.
I found a tutorial that was showing how to add a tab feature with just HTML and CSS and finally i did it
I used Flexbox and Grid for the Layout and a bit of Javascript for the modal popup when you click the log in
